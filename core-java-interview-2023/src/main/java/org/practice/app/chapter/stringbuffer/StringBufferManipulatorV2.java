* Write a java program to satisfy the statement below:-

* StringBuffer is thread-safe since it is synchronised.
* It means that two threads canâ€™t execute the StringBuffer functions at the same time.
* If they call the StringBuffer function at the same time,
* only one of the two threads acquires the lock and executes the method.
* The second thread has to wait until the execution of the first thread has been completed.
